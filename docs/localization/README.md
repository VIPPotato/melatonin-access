# Localization Workspace Helpers

This folder stores ad-hoc helper scripts and reference dumps used during localization audits.

- `parse.py`, `parse_loc.py`, `tmp_parser.ps1`: temporary parsing helpers for quick audits.
- `loc_translations.txt`, `parse_loc_source.txt`, `chinese strings fixes.txt`: captured review/reference notes.

These files are intentionally kept for future localization review passes.
